# Document-Clustering
This project explores a document clustering problem using unsupervised learning algorithms. Following tasks are addressed in this project:

1. How the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm solves the Maximum Likelihood problem for latent variable models.

2. Derivation and implementation of expectation and maximization steps of the hard-EM and soft-EM algorithm for Document Clustering.

3. Perform a PCA on the data you clustered using the hard-EM and soft-EM

The "Document Clustering" report documents the mathematical derivations of the of expectation and maximization steps of the hard-EM and soft-EM algorithm. These steps are implemented using R in the "Document Clustering.ipynb" file.
